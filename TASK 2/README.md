Task 2: Machine Learning Model Comparison Project
Overview

This project focuses on understanding and comparing different machine learning algorithms using the Wine Quality dataset. The goal was to train seven different ML models, evaluate their performance and document their differences. All models were trained using CPU in Google Colab as instructed.

Dataset>>
Dataset Used: Wine Quality Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Features: Chemical properties of wine
Target: Wine quality score (0 to 10)
The dataset was cleaned, normalized and split into training and testing sets before model training.


Models Trained>>
The following seven machine learning models were implemented:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
Naive Bayes
Neural Network (MLP Classifier)

Each model was trained using CPU only.

Evaluation Metrics>>
All models were compared using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Classification Report
These metrics helped identify strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.


Documentation Included
This task includes the following components:
Written documentation explaining each model and its use case
Handwritten notes with model differences, functions and reasoning behind metric variations
Graphs with mathematical formulas included beside each model as required

Tools and Environment>>
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib and Seaborn
Google Colab (CPU only)
